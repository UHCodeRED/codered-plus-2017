          <h3>What is CodeRED Plus?</h3>
          <p>With the success of our past hackathons and your feedback, we are excited to launch CodeRED Plus, a higher quality hackathon. This hackathon will focus on fewer, more exclusive tracks, giving you more opportunity to impress.</p>

        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <h3>What does this mean for the old CodeRED?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely nothing! We will continuously put on the largest student-run hackathon in the South Central, every fall. We’ve decided to introduce this new hackathon to double the innovation within technology.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">

          <h3>Is it free?</h3>
          <p>Yes, CodeRED is entirely free! This includes meals, transportation, and swag!</p>

          <h3>Who can attend?</h3>
          <p>All student hackers who are 16 by March 31 can attend. This includes high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.</p>

          <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
          <p>A laptop or desktop computer, student ID, chargers, a sleeping bag if desired, and any personal items.</p>

          <h3>How do I get there?</h3>
          <p>Complimentary bus passes will be provided to participants from select schools within Texas.
          If you are travelling from out of Texas, plan ahead and make sure to apply early to request a travel reimbursement!</p>

          <h3>I drove myself, where can I park?</h3>
          <p>CodeRED provides free parking to all hackers attending the event. Maps will be sent by email.</p>

          <h3>Will there be travel reimbursements?</h3>
          <p>Yes, if you are traveling from out of state you may request a travel reimbursement.
          The deadline to request a travel reimbursement with your application is March 1. Please note,
          however, we are not offering travel reimbursements for international travel.</p>

        <div class="w-col w-col-6">

          <h3>How do teams work?</h3>
          <p>We suggest teams of no more than four, as prizes are limited to four per team.
          If you already have a team, you can identify your teammates by email on the application.</p>

          <h3>What if I don't have a team?</h3>
          <p>You can always form a team at the event, or you can work solo.
          Some of the best projects and hackathon experiences come from meeting and working with other makers and hackers!</p>

          <h3>What if I don't know how to code?</h3>
          <p>That's okay! We don't actually have any requirement stating you need to have experience.
          You will probably want to form a team with people who do, though! A huge part of the hackathon experience is
          learning new ideas and technologies from other hackers, our mentors, and our sponsors.</p>

          <h3>Can I be a volunteer?</h3>
          <p>Yes, we would love your help. <a href="http://cougarcs.com/codered-volunteer/" target="_blank">Sign up to volunteer here</a>.</p>

          <h3>What is your Code of Conduct?</h3>
          <p>CodeRED Plus operates under the MLH Code of Conduct.
          You can <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank">read it here</a>.</p>

          <h3>How can I contact a human?</h3>
          <p>We've got a sweet chat button in the bottom right corner of your screen, but you can always email us at
          <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.</p>
